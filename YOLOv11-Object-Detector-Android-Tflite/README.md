# YOLOv11 Live Object Detection Android Application

## üìú Description
This Android application leverages the YOLOv11 machine learning model to perform live object detection. YOLOv11 builds on the capabilities of previous YOLO versions (YOLOv8 and YOLOv9) and offers enhanced real-time object detection for Android devices. Since as of now the implementation for YOLOv11 is the same as YOLOv8 and YOLOv9, you may also refer to those repositories to get started with code:
